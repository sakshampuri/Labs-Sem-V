    "#Vehicle silhouettes\n",

    "##Objective\n",
    "To classify a given silhouette as one of four types of vehicle, \tusing a set of features extracted from the silhouette. The \tvehicle may be viewed from one of many different angles.   \n",
    "\n",
    "##Description\n",
    "\n",
    "###The features were extracted from the silhouettes by the HIPS\n",
    "(Hierarchical Image Processing System) extension BINATTS, which extracts a combination of scale independent features utilising\tboth classical moments based measures such as scaled variance,\tskewness and kurtosis about the major/minor axes and heuristic\tmeasures such as hollows, circularity, rectangularity and\tcompactness. Four \"Corgie\" model vehicles were used for the experiment: a double decker bus, Cheverolet van, Saab 9000 and an Opel Manta 400.\tThis particular combination of vehicles was chosen with the expectation that the bus, van and either one of the cars would be readily distinguishable, but it would be more difficult to distinguish between the cars.\n",
